Better Call Saul...
Should I settle?
Hector Salamanca.
- Turn the lights on.
- I'm back to normal.
You'd rather tear down
HHM than retire.
You think I'm trouble now?
Imagine me as your enemy.
It's a new client, and
if I mess this up, it's a former client.
Sandpiper is settling.
This is the solution to everything!
I'll be back in a few hours.
"It was very still
except for the tree-toads
and the frogs in the brook
peeping mournfully,






and every little while
Mabel could hear strange
rustlings in the leaves.
She
tried to remember the way home,
but the woods
looked so different now
that she couldn't think
which way to go.
She began to be frightened.
'What's that?' Said Mabel.
'Oh, I'm...
I'm so frightened!'
in a minute or two
she heard the howl again...
'o-o-o-w!'...
a long, wild cry.
She began to run, but the poor
thing had lost her way."
Is she gonna be okay?
She'll be fine, Jimmy.
How do you know?






Just listen.
You'll see.

Kim.
I know.
Does she need
to spend the night?
Once this is Done,
she'll be discharged.
Good.
Lawsuits.
Threats.
Recriminations.
This is a situation
no firm ever wants to be in.
It's... Well, it's embarrassing.
I know we all want
a swift resolution here.
So what are our options?
Take it to trial.
Expensive.
And extremely damaging
for HHM's reputation.
Not my first choice or yours,
I imagine.
The firm could choose
to buy me out
for an amount that is
almost certain to bankrupt it.
I spent decades
building this firm.
I Don't want to be the agent
of its destruction.
There is a third option.
There's no reason
we can't put all this
unpleasantness behind us
and continue on as we have been.
I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.
And if you agree,
I think we can settle all this
right now
with a simple handshake.
Would you all give us the room
for a moment?
17 years.
18 in July, actually.
All those years
we built this place together.
And all that time
I've supported you.
Looked up to you,
deferred to you.
Because I always thought
you had the best interests
of the firm in mind.
I have...
Mnh.
You did.
For a long time.
But you've let
personal vendettas
turn your focus away
from what's best for HHM.
You've put your needs first.
To our detriment.
I Don't think that's accurate.
And the moment
that I mildly suggest,
with empathy and concern,
that maybe it's time for you
to consider retirement...
the first instinct you have
is to sue me?!
To sue the firm...?
Well, I... I-i Don't even know...
I- in what world is that anything
but the deepest betrayal
of everything we worked so hard
to accomplish?
In what world is that anything
but the deepest betrayal
of our friendship?
Howard. I could argue that
you're the one who betrayed me.
That's bullshit.
And you know it.
This is pointless.
Here.
Just take this.
$3 million?
The first of three payments,
as per
the partnership agreement.
The firm can't afford this.
Are you...
You're not shutting down,
are you?
I would never endanger the firm.
This is mostly
from my personal funds.
And a few loans.
You're paying me
out of your own pocket.
You won.
There's one last thing...
Everybody!
Thank you for gathering.
I have some bittersweet news
to share.
I'm sorry to say, but our
fearless leader, Charles McGill,
will be leaving HHM.
Effective immediately.
I wanted to take this moment
to thank Chuck
for everything he's Done
for HHM.
We started off
with six employees.
And Chuck helped grow us
into one of the largest firms
in the state.
We will be forever grateful
for his dedication.
Do you have anything
you want to say?
Alright, then.
Let's give him a hand!
Hey.
Morning.
Close.
Gatorade.
You need electrolytes.
You hungry?
I'll make you somethin'.
Be right back.
Just finish that.
Hey.
I said I'd bring it to you.
I needed to stretch my legs.
Sit.
Eggs.
This is, uh, twisted.
Oh, thanks.
This one-handed crap is gonna
get real old, real fast.
Is there coffee?
Sure.
But, uh, more gatorade first.
Alright, your, uh,
two options are...
Good ole' ibuprofen
which, uh, you know,
should take the edge off.
Or the proverbial
"good stuff."
The answer is always
"the good stuff."
Right.
But food first.
You're not feeding me, Jimmy.
There are lines we do not cross.
I was looking into our lease
on the office.
Um, we'd definitely take
a haircut if we broke it.
But we are allowed to sublet.
Might be our best option.
Furniture's mostly rented
month to month.
So that's not an issue.
For you, I think you need
a desk, some file cabinets.
A westlaw terminal...
And, uh, haven't figured out
Francesca yet.
That's another conversation.
All that sound okay?
Are you sure about this?
I mean, even with
the sandpiper money...?
Look.
After, uh...
Everything...
I Don't give a shit
about the office.
So can I start looking
for a tenant?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I could've killed someone,
Jimmy.
Yeah. Yourself.
I worked most of last week
on maybe six hours of sleep.
And then I...
I crossed three lanes

any of it...
Look, you were just doing
what you thought you had to do.
Because of me. You didn't
make me get in that car.
That was all me.
I'm an adult.
I made a choice.
Hey.
All I can say is,
I am gonna fix things.

Nope.
