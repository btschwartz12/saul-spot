She's in her room. 
 She won't come out. 
[ Grunts ] 
Assuming the dead drops 
 are real, 
Feds are going to be on them. 
-Feds? 
 -They're gunning for arrests. 
If there's no money in those
 dead drops, Lalo will know.
The dead drops remain. 
If we'd have had a house, I
 never would've wanted to leave.
You'll say anything 
to get what you want. 
Woman: Help you 
 find somethin'? 
Uh, no, thanks. 
 I'm just browsing. 






[Grunts lightly] 
[Exhaling sharply] 
Woman: 
 That still works. 
You can plug it in 
 if you want. 
Oh. Thanks. 
How much for this? 
That? 
I could let that go
 for $30. 
Um... 
$75 for all three? 
?? 
[Bells dinging]

[Birds chirping] 
[Alarm beeping] 
[Beeping stops] 
[Inhales sharply] 
[Groans lightly] 
[Exhales sharply] 
[Exhales sharply] 
[Birds chirping] 
[Groans] 
Yeah, 
 don't worry about it.
Building 
 will take care of it.
That's whatcha 
 pay rent for. 
What's your day 
 look like? 
I got MDC 
 in the morning 
and, uh, 
 court in the afternoon.
Oh, and I'm finally doing
 that lunch with Howard.
Yeah? 
 See what he wants.
Hopefully it will be
 short and sweet. 
You? 
Uh... 
yesterday was bad. 
Today 
 I'm gonna fix it. 
Sounds like a plan.
 [Smooches] 
See ya. 
[Car door opens] 
Pull the initial research we did
 on Lot 2375. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, all of it. 
Uh, permit status, 
 costs, projections. 
Uh-huh. Are they on digital? 
Good. How are you on PowerPoint?
Great. I'll walk you through 
 what I need when I get in. 
I should be there in 20. 
I'll see you when I get there. 
[Broom clatters] 
[Glass clanks] 
[Indistinct conversations] 
[Door closes] 
[Lock engages] 
[Sighs] 
You gentlemen have had 
 a busy week, huh? 
[Both chuckle] 
Bail has been denied. 
No mystery there. 
Okay. 
 Let's start at the beginning. 
Somehow you two 
 are short on priors, 
so I think I can get the DA 
 to knock the drug charges down 
to simple possession. 
We can lay responsibility
 for the felonies 
at the doorstep 
of your unfortunate dependence
 on hard drugs, 
but we're gonna have to argue
 for rehab 
as part of probation --
Hells naw. 
 I hate rehab. 
 Alright. 
Don't get 
 all in a twist, okay?
I've heard 
 that there exist 
certain less-than-reputable
 establishments 
that will 
 provide certification
without the pleasure
 of your actual attendance.
You know a place 
 like that? 
I could conceivably find such
 a place for an additional fee.
Alright, 'cause I ain't 
 going to no rehab. 
Mnh-mnh. 
 You go, 
 you don't go -- 
that's between you 
 and your God. 
But you got to tell the judge
 you'll go, 
and you got to sound like
 you mean it, 'kay? 
Yeah. Yeah. 
 Yeah, okay. 
Well, all that's left is
 your many, many misdemeanors,
which include 
 graffiti, vandalism,
littering, 
 public urination. 
[Laughs] 
Nature's calling you, 
you got to answer it. 
H-Hold it too long, 
 you get kidney-stoned. 
[Sighs] 
Be that as it may, um, 
 even misdemeanors add up. 
So, if I can get you 
 concurrent sentences, 
you're looking at... 
12 months in stir. 
Now, with good behavior 
 and overcrowding, 
takes it down to six, 
 maybe five months. 
That's minimum security. 
It's gonna be like 
 taking a cruise... 
[Sighs heavily] 
...only less danger 
 of drowning. 
Christ, man, 
 five months? 
Down from five years, 
 consecutive, 
or worse if they get 
 this heavy stuff to stick. 
Now, come on. 
You do your months, you do 
 a little community service, 
maybe a year probation, 
 and you're gold, Ponyboy. 
Sound good? 
Yeah, okay. 
We -- Yeah, we -- 
 we can take that. 
No doubt. 
 Great. 
So, all that's left 
 is my fee. 
[Clears throat] 
Okay, so, for my time, 
 court costs, filing fees, 
you're looking at, 
 oh, let's say about... 
four grand, all-in. 
S-Say what? 
Yo, 
d-don't play us like that. 
What about 50% off? 
That is 50% off. 
Now, my normal rate 
 would be 4K each. 
Dude, 
 this is B.S. 
They got lawyers here
 they gotta give us.
You pay nothing. 
Free lawyers? 
 Public 'fenders. 
Four grand, we can get
 a lot of scante, man.
I'm sorry. Free lawyer? 
Y-You saying that you want 
 a free lawyer? 
We're just 
talkin' over options. 
And, you know, 
 free is, you know, free.
Did you ever hear the phrase 
 "you get what you pay for," 
you nudnik? 
Without me, 
they're gonna lock you up 
 and throw away the key. 
I'm sorry. 
 Did I say five years? 
You -- You go ahead 
and play Russian roulette 
 with a public pretender, 
you're gonna end up doing 
 a decade in Los Lunas. 
You twerps 
 even know who I am? 
I am Saul Goodman! 
Okay? 
 You think 4K is too much? 
Yesterday I got paid 8K 
 just for the afternoon. 
That's how good I am. 
I am the real deal. 
You're lucky 
 I'm even talkin' to ya. 
Y'know what? 
 [Chuckles] 
[Pounds on door] 
 Hey, c-c'mon, man. 
Hey, alright. 
 D-Don't be like that. 
Hey, we're sorry, yo.
 We're sorry. 
Y-You -- 
w-w-w-w-we wanna go with you. 
Hunny-percent.
 Please, sir. 
Okay. 
We're back on the same page, 
 though -- payment. 
Yeah. 
 Yeah. 
Before you make my headache 
 even worse, 
no, you cannot pay me 
 with the money you stole. 
Okay, that cash is Exhibit A 
 for the prosecution. 
So, relatives? 
Anybody you haven't 
 already fleeced? 
My grandma maybe? 
Yeah, 
she -- she got a house... 
Yeah. 
 ...and a car 
 and shizz. 
Yeah, grandma. 
 She's perfect. 
Okay, so, you tell granny
 faster she gets me my money,
faster 
 I work my magic. 
My wire info 
 is on the back of that card.
I look forward 
 to hearing from her.
[Pounds on door] 
 Coming out! 
[Indistinct conversations] 
[Door closes, lock engages] 
[ "Spirit of Birdland" playing]
Man: Fantastic. 
 [Sighs] 
[Indistinct conversations] 
I'm sorry I'm late.
It's just 
 one of those days. 
No problem. 
 Let me introduce you. 
Judge Lawler, 
 this is Jimmy McGill. 
Uh, it's actually 
 Saul Goodman. 
I changed my name. 
But Lawler -- 
 now you're Federal, right?
Uh, District of New Mexico?
That's me. 
 Thought so. 
Your gavel work 
 is legendary. 
Uh...thank you? 
I'll let you get back 
 to your lunch, Ian. 
Catch you on the back nine 
 next week. 
See you. 
 Jimmy? 
And I'll have 
 the sole and -- 
No butter, 
 side of steamed veggies? 
You got me. 
 Creature of habit. 
 [Chuckles] Great. 
I'll put this in, 
and I'll be right back 
 with your drink. 
?? 
[Chuckles, sniffles]
?? 
So. 
"Saul Goodman." 
Am I allowed 
to call you "Jimmy"? 
Uh, Saul Goodman 
 is my professional name,
but my friends 
 still call me Jimmy.
You can, too. 
Well, tell me about 
 "Saul Goodman." 
[Clears throat] 
 Whaddya mean? 
Well, 
 what I mean is, 
if he's not Jimmy McGill, 
 who is he? 
What's he about? 
Uh...hmm. 
 Well... 
Saul Goodman is, 
 uh -- 
he's the last line of defense
 for the little guy.
You getting sold 
 down the river? 
He's a life raft. 
You getting stepped on,
 he's a sharp stick.
You got Goliath 
 on your back, 
Saul's the guy 
 with the slingshot.
He's a righter 
 of wrongs. 
He's friend 
 to the friendless. 
That's Saul Goodman.
[Chuckles] Wow. 
[Chuckles] 
?? 
Couldn't Jimmy McGill 
 do all that? 
?? 
Maybe he could, 
 but, uh, Saul Goodman is.
[Sniffles] 
I get it. 
 You do? 
Yeah. 
I understand why 
you changed your name. 
Is that right? 
Hamlin Hamlin McGill 
 did you wrong. 
Your name 
is a part of that firm. 
Now it's tainted. 
We took your legacy 
 away from you. 
You say so, 
 Howard. 
No, no, I've been 
thinking about this a lot. 
And you know what? 
We should have hired you. 
I mean, 
 don't worry about it.
That's ancient history.
You deserved a shot. 
And I could've given it 
 to you... 
when you got barred or 
when you brought us Sandpiper. 
Both times, 
I should've shown some backbone.
It would've been 
the right thing to do. 
Well, 
 I am glad you had 
this cleansing moment
 of clarity, Howard.
Good for you. 
[Chuckles] 
?? 
Let me be clear. 
I'm not interested 
 in yesterday. 
I missed an opportunity 
 with you, 
and I think it's time 
 to correct that. 
?? 
I'd like you 
to come work at HHM. 
?? 
[Clears throat] 
[Ice cubes clinking] 
[Slurps, 
 exhales sharply] 
You want me 
 to work for you 
after all the shit 
 that's happened between us?
Oh, as far 
 as I'm concerned, 
that's between 
 you and Chuck. 
?? 
[Scoffs] 
Hey, look, 
 before you offer me a job,
you might want to call
 your buddy Cliff Main.
He'd have a unique perspective
 on employing me. 
This isn't a spur-of-the-moment 
 decision, Jimmy. 
I have been considering this 
 for a while. 
At the scholarship committee, 
you spoke about 
 that young woman. 
Kristy Esposito. 
Yes. Kristy. 
 Yeah. 
You stood up 
 for her. 
And that 
 got me thinking... 
about judgment... 
and honesty. 
?? 
[Chuckles] 
And when you kicked my ass 
 last year, 
you weren't wrong. 
You say 
 what you mean. 
Listen, you don't wanna be
 surrounded by liars, Howard,
you might be 
 in the wrong profession.
[Chuckles] 
Look, 
 it's simple for me. 
You're smart. 
 You're scrappy. 
You're a go-getter. 
You don't wait 
for things to happen. 
You make 'em happen. 
HHM is growing again 
and could use 
 someone like you. 
?? 
I could use you. 
"Charlie Hustle." 
[Inhales sharply] 
 Howard, I -- 
You don't have to answer 
 right now. 
Let's just enjoy lunch. 
But do me a favor. 
Live with it 
 for a bit. 
Okay? 
?? 
[Slurping] 
?? 
[Horn honks] 
Ah. That's me. 
Well, Howard, 
 this was, um... 
Thanks for lunch. 
 I'll get the next one.
Thanks for 
 taking the time. 
[Car door closes] 
 Good to see you, 
 Jimmy. 
[Chuckles] 
[Air brakes hiss] 
[Engine rumbling] 
[Car door closes] 
Paige: If you glance 
 at the package, 
it'll give you a clear idea 
of what we're talking about. 
There's a raft 
of TCPA compliance issues, 
but they're 
fairly straightforward. 
We've been in touch 
with the FTC, the FCC. 
OSHA, same. 
By the time 
 construction's complete,
we'll be able 
 to hire able bodies,
and we'll be 
 ready to go. 
Exciting to expand beyond 
the ol' brick and mortar. 
We've hit 
 all the key benchmarks
for the Tucumcari 
 call center. 
And we remain 
 well under budget. 
You know 
 I like to hear that. 
 [Chuckling] Alright. 
If you turn 
 to the next tab, 
there are some 
 mortgage opportunities --
Sorry. 
Paige, there's one more piece 
 of call center business 
I feel 
 we need to discuss. 
Oh... 
 Stef? 
Okay. 
 [Screen clicking] 
Kim: We decided 
 to put this center here,
on this parcel of land,
 Lot 1102. 
But I think we need to
 reconsider the other contender,
Lot 2375. 
Paige: 2375 -- the vacant lot 
with the flooding problem? 
Yes, 
 that's right. 
Initially, we did have concerns
 about the infrastructure,
but I spoke with Alex Amadeo
 on the Council this morning,
and she told me the city 
 has recently shored up 
all of the drainage 
 along the arroyo. 
And they have repaved 10 miles 
 of roads in the vicinity. 
So that would not only 
 speed up our construction, 
but make for a more efficient
 operation overall. 
And over the long term,
 it seems to me 
that these improvements
 will pay dividends 
and more than offset
 any delays. 
Since we won't need
 a redesign, 
we could be back on track in
 a matter of two to three weeks,
maybe less. 
Are you saying 
that we lose three weeks 
and, what, eat the cost 
of the land that we already own?
I know this isn't really
 my department, 
but according to 
 our own projections,
the land we already own
 will more than double in value
in the next five years.
This could be 
 an excellent investment.
There's potential here
 to turn Tucumcari 
into a real Mesa Verde
 company town. 
And when you add in
 the -- the reputational risk
with Lot 1102 -- 
"Reputational risk"? 
You're talking about 
 Everett Acker? 
[Inhales sharply] 
Ousting a man 
 from his house -- 
it's never 
 a good look. 
Kevin: Kim, let me ask this 
 real plainly. 
Is Lot 1102 our land 
 or not? 
Are we in the right? 
As far as the law goes,
 yes. 
Alright, then. 
Well, 
 that settles it. 
I'm not gonna let anybody 
 chase me off. 
This fella wants to make a fuss,
 well... 
it's our land and our right 
 to do with it what we want. 
I agree. 
We've already offered him 
a sum for relocation 
far greater than what we've paid
any of his neighbors. 
Kim... 
 thank you for the thought, 
but I say we move forward 
 with Lot 1102. 
How 'bout 
 we get the lights? 
Yeah, alright then.
 That's that. 
I just 
 had to mention it. 
[Clears throat] 
I've got a call in 
 to the sheriff. 
Come Friday at noon, 
Acker will be out 
and construction will proceed. 
Now, as I was saying -- 
 mortgages. 
Our institutional clients 
 are strong, 
but if we want to penetrate 
 the retail market, 
there are some opportunities 
that we should explore 
as we develop 
 the business. 
[Keys jingle] 
[Birds chirping] 
[Vehicle approaching] 
[Brakes squeal] 
[Engine shuts off] 
Pop, 
what are you doing here? 
It's Thursday. 
 It's my day. 
You didn't get 
 my message? 
I called you 
to see if you were coming. 
You never called me back, 
so I had Emily come. 
It's okay. 
 Send her home. 
I'll pay her 
 for the night. 
Well... 
maybe it's better 
if you just sit this one out. 
I mean, they're already off 
 playing dolls. 
I scared her. 
 I lost my temper. 
That's it. 
If you just 
 let me talk to her,
tell her I'm sorry --
 No, no, no, no. 
Kaylee's fine. 
She forgot all about that. 
Then what's the problem?
[Sighs] 
I love you, 
 Pop, 
but tonight I think 
you should let Emily babysit. 
Honey, I'm okay. 
I wouldn't tell you I was okay
 if I wasn't. 
And if Kaylee 
 brings up Matty? 
I'll be okay. 
You're getting worked up
 over nothing. 
I'm fine. 
Look, what if maybe you come 
for dinner sometime next week? 
We can have those pork chops 
 you like. 
You've been working 
 so hard. 
You deserve 
 a little break. 
Let you 
get back to yourself. 
"Get back to myself"?
[Exhales sharply] 
Something's going on 
 with you. 
I don't know what. 
But I'd be 
 more comfortable 
if you didn't sit 
 for Kaylee. 
For tonight. 
[Sighs] 
[Birds chirping] 
[Dog barks in distance] 
[Indistinct conversations] 
[Door closes] 
Harkness: 
 We were hopping 
'cause of that Kiss show
 at the pavilion. 
I had those leather guys
 in makeup 
coming in and buy Slim Jims
 and beers all night long.
Ko: Thank you, 
 Mr. Harkness. 
Is the person who robbed you 
present in the court today? 
Yes. 
And could you point him out 
to the court, please? 
There. 
Let the record show 
that the witness has identified 
the defendant, 
 Mr. Sakey. 
Thank you, 
 Mr. Harkness. 
Judge: 
 Your witness, Mr. Goodman. 
[Inhales sharply] 
Thank you for coming in today, 
 Mr. Harkness. 
I just want to clarify a few 
things from your testimony, 
if that's okay. 
'Kay. 
So, you were working 
 at the Sandia Mart 
the night 
 of the 30th. 
Is that correct? 
Got in at noon, 
 left at midnight. 
That's a long day. 
 Mm-hmm. 
Good for you. 
Nothing wrong 
with a hard day's work. 
So, 
you say a man came in 
and he reached 
 across the counter 
and, uh, quote, 
"He grabbed up the money 
 from my register 
and run off." 
Yeah. 
And there was no one else 
 in the store? 
Not at that time, 
 no. 
And since the camera system 
wasn't working at the time, 
you're the only one 
who saw the perpetrator. 
Yeah. 
 I guess so. 
[Sighs] 
Yeah. 
So, this person came in, 
and they bought something. 
I think 
 it was an Almond Joy.
And they bought 
 an Almond Joy. 
And when 
 you rang them up, 
that's when they snatched 
the cash from the register. 
Sounds like it happened 
 pretty fast, 
but you say you got 
a good look at 'em, correct? 
Yes. 
[Exhales sharply] 
You must drink 
stronger coffee than I do 
'cause after 11 hours 
 on the job, 
I can barely 
 see straight. 
And it was dark out. 
Well, he was the only guy
 that came in that night
that wasn't made up like
 a bat or a cat 
or whatever the hell
 those guys are. 
A-And he was 
 right up in my face.
Right in your f-- A-And 
according to your testimony, 
you feel confident that 
you can identify this person. 
That's what 
 you're saying. 
I can, absolutely. 
It's him. 
Your client. 
Are you sure 
 that's the person? 
There's no doubt in your mind? 
 Take your time. 
I don't need time. 
 That's him. 
[Chuckles] 
Now, would you be surprised 
to learn, Mr. Harkness, 
that the person you just 
pointed to is not the defendant?
Wh-What? 
My client is 
in the back of the courtroom. 
Mr. Sakey, 
would you please stand up? 
Ko: Objection! 
The person you ID'ed 
is named Hollis Earley. 
He's a bartender 
 down in Belen. 
He has a very good alibi 
for the night in question. 
Your Honor, objection! 
[Spectators murmuring] 
 Oh, Mr. Goodman! 
Really? 
 You didn't recognize him, 
 either, Your Honor. 
Alright, settle -- settle down,
 everybody. Settle. Settle. 
[Gavel banging] 
[Murmuring stops] 
 [Sighs] 
Ladies and gentlemen 
 of the jury, 
we're gonna call it a day. 
I will have very specific 
 instructions for you tomorrow. 
As always, please refrain from 
 discussing the case until then,
and I will see counsel 
 in my chambers now. 
[Gavel bangs] 
Adjourned. 
[Door opens] 
[Indistinct conversations] 
[Door opens] 
[Door opens] 
[Door creaks, closes] 
You're still here. 
 Yeah. 
You saw the fireworks. 
It was 
 a bit unorthodox. 
But, uh, 
 check this out. 
Two sweetest words 
in the English language -- 
"miss," "trial." 
Not bad, huh? 
Not bad. 
[Stammers] 
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
It's just... 
I have a case 
 in Tucumcari. 
And there's something 
I want to discuss with you. 
[Indistinct conversations] 
[Metal clanging] 
Lyle: Fry pit looks good, 
 Deshawn. 
You can take off. 
Night, Tiffany. 
 Good work. 
Good work. 
Juana, 
 very good work. 
Crap, 
 I forgot to cover the fryer.
Uh, y-- don't worry. 
I'll get it. 
 [Engine starts] 
Thanks, man. 
 Sure. 
See you tomorrow, 
 Deshawn. 
[Lock engages] 
[Keys jingle] 
[Vehicle departing] 
[Metal clanging] 
[Sighs] 
Everything alright,
 Mr. Fring? 
This is acceptable 
 to you? 
Uh... 
I thought 
 Deshawn did a good job.
Uh... 
I'm not 
 seeing anything. 
It's... 
I understand. 
Uh, you know... 
like, 
now that I look closer, 
yeah, 
I think I see maybe... 
Yeah. Okay. 
I'll take care of it,
 Mr. Fring. 
Alright. 
Yeah. 
Sorry about that. Sorry. 
[Metal clangs] 
[Breathes deeply] 
[Metal clanging] 
[Sizzling] 
[Train whistle blows] 
Who puts a dead drop
 in a culvert? 
I mean, rain comes 
 and -- fsssht! -- 
your money's on its way
 to the, uh, Rio Grande.
So you use a different drop 
during the monsoon season. 
"Culvert." [Chuckles]
That's a weird word.
What do you think that is,
 like Dutch? 
Maybe French. 
It's not French. 
In Spanish, 
it's "alcantarilla." 
Well, it -- 
 it doesn't come from Spanish.
I mean, you ever hear anyone
 walk around 
talk about the majestic
 "culverts of Spain"?
Who the hell goes around talking
about "majestic culverts"? 
Man: Target is approaching 
 position two. 
Stand by. 
Copy. 
 Standing by. 
[Exhales sharply] 
Well... 
 only one drop left.
That's us. 
You think 
 he'll do all three? 
Well, Molina's info
 has checked out so far.
Long as we don't 
 spook the target, 
I say he, uh, 
rounds third 
 and goes straight for home.
You know 
 how to use that thing?
Point it at the bad guy, 
 press the button. 
[Chuckles] 
Don't miss your shot,
 Ansel Adams. 
We need this guy. 
Position two, 
 we have the target. 
Looks like 
 he's headed inside. 
Copy. 
[Exhales heavily] 
"Culvert." 
"Cullll-vert." 
Sounds like a Dutch word
 for crotch rot. 
[Chuckles] 
Target is on the move, 
 headed toward position three. 
Alright, guys, 
 keep your distance.
Hey, Byers and Vacca,
 roll back 30 yards.
If I can see ya, 
 he can, too. 
We don't want him 
 to get nervous. 
Want to keep him 
 nice and relaxed. 
[Radio thuds] 
Like your mom 
 on date night. 
Like your left hand 
 every night. 
[Metal clangs] 
Is it okay, 
 Mr. Fring? 
You can go home, 
 Lyle. 
I-If it's not right,
 just let me try again.
I-I can get this right
 for you, sir. 
Please. 
If you would like to take 
another crack at it, 
then go ahead. 
Thank you.

[Engine starts, rumbles] 
[Tires screech] 
God damn it! 
Hey, uh, yeah, 
 our target's in flight.
All units, uh... 
[Engine starts] 
...going West on Bobby Foster.
 We're in pursuit. 
?? 
What're you doin'?! 
Getting ahead of him.
Got to skate to where
 the puck's gonna be.
But you don't know 
 where he's goin'! 
I got a feeling.

[Tires screech] 
[Gun cocks] 
?? 
?? 
[Tires screech] 
?? 
Federal agents! 
Come on out! 
[Engine rumbling] 
Nice and slow! 
Hands! 
Show me your hands! 
?? 
Damn it. 
[Engine revving] 
[Tires screech]

[Sighs heavily]

Schrader! 
[Sighs heavily] 
[Water dripping] 
[Sirens wailing in distance] 
Well, 
 what do you say, Gomey?
Let's spelunk. 
[Engine rumbling] 
[Crickets chirping] 
[Grunts] 
[Car door closes] 
[Speaks Spanish] 
Vamonos. 
[Gearshift clicks] 
$696,000, $698,000,
 $700,000 and some change.
Damn. 
We sure took a bite
 out of crime tonight, McGruff.
Mnh, 
 booby prize. 
C'mon, man. 
 We got the money. 
We got the douchebags
 who did the drop. 
We got 
 three assholes in cuffs.
And we put Molina 
 back out on the street.
Who knows what else
 he's gonna scare up?
Yeah, I wanted to go upstream, 
Gomey, not downstream. 
[Breathes deeply] 
[Police radio chatter] 
Here goes. 
Alrighty. 
Everybody, circle up! 
 Circle up! 
Come on! 
 Bring it in! 
I just want to thank y'all 
for a successful operation. 
Great work across the board. 
APD -- hey, 
 you guys are first-rate. 
We're putting bracelets 
 on three shitbirds as we speak.
And better yet, we got ourselves
 a buttload of money, alright? 
Just shy of $1 million. 
So some major dickwad 
 of a dealer's hurtin' tonight. 
And that's because of 
 all of you. 
So, to show my appreciation, 
we're all going to O'Neill's, 
 and first round's on me. 
Yeah! Alright! 
[Cheers and applause] 
 Thank y'all! 
[Cellphone vibrating] 
Victor: 
 All clear. 
And the money? 
They got it. 
Went down 
like it was supposed to. 
[Metal clangs] 
Mr. Fring. 
I was just about 
 to come find you. 
Thank you, Lyle. 
 You can go home. 
Um, but is it, 
 like... 
You think it's okay? 
 It's clean? 
It is acceptable. 
[Metal clanging] 
Have a good night, 
 Mr. Fring. 
[Birds chirping] 
[Sniffles] 
[Exhales sharply] 
[Knock on door] 
[Footsteps approaching] 
[Lock disengages] 
Who the hell are you?
Mr. Acker, 
my name is Saul Goodman. 
I'm an attorney -- 
I've had it up to here
 with you Mesa Verde scumbags.
Get bent! 
I'm not 
representing Mesa Verde. 
In fact, 
I'd like to represent you, sir. 
I don't need a lawyer,
 I don't want a lawyer,
nothin' you can say
 is gonna change my mind.
Now, 
 move your damn foot.
Sir, 
if you would just -- just -- 
Please just take a look 
at my proposal, okay? 
Because I think 
you'll find it persuasive. 
I don't want it. 
Just look at it, sir. 
 Just look. 
What do you see? 
A man... 
...f-fuckin' a horse.
Sir, 
 I hate Mesa Verde. 
I hate them. 
Looking down on us 
from their glass tower. 
They think they can shit on 
 whoever they want 
and we just have to smile 
and say, "Thank you"? 
Look, picture me as the man 
and Mesa Verde as the horse. 
I'm the guy who'll do 
 whatever it takes 
to stick it to them. 
Guess who's got a new client 
 in Tucumcari. 
Kim: Wh-What? 
 That's right. 
Put some beers on ice. 
We'll celebrate when I get back 
from the hinterlands. 
[Laughing] Yes. 
That's the best news
 I've heard all day.
How the hell 
 did you convince him?
Uh... 
 uh, visual aids. 
You'd be surprised what 
you can find on that Internet. 
So, 
 Chinese tonight? 
Yeah, sounds good. 
I'll see you later.
 Bye. 
What'd y'all get into 
 last night? 
[Scoffs] 
 Absolutely nothing, G.
Yo, G, 
 pass that lighter, G. 
Hey, yo, yo, your girl 
 came by. You need to 
 keep her in check, fam. 
She trippin', 
 man. 
I've been telling you 
 about that, man. 
Black her eyes. 
 Hey, yo, yo, yo. 
Ain't that... 
 Yo, that's... 
Yo, Gramps! 
[Grunts, coughs] 
Ugh! 
[All grunting] 
First one was free, 
 dickhead!
