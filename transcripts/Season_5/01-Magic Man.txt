Aw, aw... Come on, man.
I just want to say hi. I'm a big fan.
Back in the day, when I lived

You got me mixed up with someone.

- Double the price.

No, no, it's fine.

- You're gonna call yourself Saul Goodman?
I'm already calling myself Saul Goodman.
We've talked about this.
The skells who've been buying my phones,
sure as shooting, sooner or later,
every last one of them is gonna find
themselves in the back of a squad car.
How do I get them to call Jimmy McGill?
I don't.
I stay Saul Goodman,
they call the guy they already know.
I thought I was wasting a year of my life.
It wasn't a waste. It was for this.
This is it.

- Just now! Back there! Boom! It hit me!
This is the way. Kim, it's gonna work.

All of a sudden, I've got it

This is right.
So let me just... I'll get this done,

I mean...
unless, is there some angle

If you want me to slow my roll,
I can come back and do this another day.

There's also this.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
"World's second best lawyer. Again."
That's the real mistake.
"World's second best lawyer."
Because Saul Goodman is gonna give you
a run for your money.
Bet he will.
Thank you.
For everything.
Really.
You know what?
The real trick is gonna be
to get my clients to know
that the cell-phone guy is now a lawyer.
- Their lawyer.
- Yep, that'll be a trick.
What I'm thinking is,
see, I've still got almost a full pallet
of cell phones left,
so why not run a promotion?
I'll make a real event out of it.
I'll give them away, okay?
And, uh, for added sweetener,
limited time only,
um, non-violent felonies, 50 percent off.
You know, just like, uh, commit
four felonies, you get the fifth one free.
And there will be friends and family too,
so you can share them around.
Really?
Yeah. I mean, it's just...
Get people in the door,
once they're hooked, I will upsell them.
Doesn't that sound like you're encouraging
these people to commit crimes?
Ha, ha. They don't need encouragement.
Believe me.
- One scoop or two?
- One.
Kim, you don't know these assholes
like I do.
Rain or shine, these morons
will be out there doing stupid shit

Little discount won't make

Do you want sprinkles?
Because I'm having sprinkles.
Uh, sure.
I'm just worried

You know what, when you're right,
you're right.
What am I doing cutting prices?
Discount is a desperation move.
See?
This is why this works.
I go too far, and you pull me back.
Don't you think
you're selling yourself short?
You worked so hard
to get your licence back.
We worked.

So many trucks.
Are all those buildings

BOLSA:
Please sit.
There's a serious matter to discuss.
Of course, Don Juan.
You may have noticed
that some of the product is altered.
Gustavo will explain.
I have a confession to make.
A man was working for me
on the legitimate side of my business.
He was supervising a construction project.
A German engineer.
I think you know his name.
Werner Ziegler.
But through an oversight, Ziegler
became aware of our other activities.
The temptation was too great
for him to resist
and he stole two keys of product.
I believe you know the rest of the story.
You know of Ziegler's escape,
you know that my man tracked him down.
My shame...
is not simply that I allowed this
to happen...
it's that I hid the truth.
When I discovered what Ziegler had done,
I replaced the stolen product
with methamphetamine I purchased locally.
Some of this inferior product went
to your organisation.
And for that...
I must apologise.
Sincerely.
What construction project?
I mean, you said
the German was building something.
What?
Ah.
It would be simpler for me to show you.
[WHIRRING]
GUS:
When finished,
this will be the most advanced

These are Ziegler's men,
working from his plans.
As far as they're concerned,
their leader has gone home.
BOLSA: Nothing was keeping you
from sharing all this.
A lot of trouble could have been avoided.
GUS: Yes, there were any number
of misunderstandings.
My man didn't know who was following him,
and as a result, he went to great lengths
to conceal his activities.
Your man...
"Michael," is that right?
Yes.
That's not him, is it?
It is.
Well, I'd love to say hello
if that's permitted.
Most certainly.

Michael, please meet

Thank you, Michael.
Well...
That explains everything.
- I'm glad you are satisfied.
BOLSA: Listen to me.
There must be no more trouble.
You two must coexist.
This is non-negotiable.
Gustavo, there can be no more secrets.
Yes.
Don Eladio is not happy.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
I do.
Then we're done.
You know, it's gonna be
a very nice chiller.
South wall's gonna look beautiful.
BOLSA [IN SPANISH]:
Why are you in the North?
LALO [IN SPANISH]:
To protect my family's interests.
BOLSA:
Following Gustavo's men? Spying on him?
And this business at TravelWire. Messy.
This is not how we conduct ourselves
this side of the border.
Look. I apologise.
It's my uncle's influence.
You know what Hector's like.
So suspicious, so unreasonable.
Hector has this crazy idea in his head
that somehow, the chicken man
might carry a grudge after he
shot Fring's boyfriend in the head.
[LAUGHS]
You don't understand Gustavo.
With him, it's all business.
All business?
Like what happened in Santiago?
Was that business too?
I need to know that this is done with.
[SIGHS]
You trust Fring?
He'll never be one of us, but he earns.
As long as he brings in the dollars,
Eladio is happy.
That's all that matters.
Then there's nothing more to say.
- Give my best to your uncle.
- I will.

Yeah, a, uh, knuckle-duster. A fistfight.
I'm thinking you might be

You press that, and poof! I'm there.

I'm the lawyer who's gonna fight for you.
You might find yourself

RPGs, maybe a couple
of claymore mines in the trunk. Heh, heh.
Before you know it, the other guy
is bleeding out on the pavement
and the cops are giving you the evil eye.
It's just that people are always
looking over each other's shoulder.
And you're not hurting anyone,
you know? Who doesn't wanna be...
Next. Big fella outside,
his name's Huell Babineaux.
Go ask Huell about me.
He was facing three years.
He was facing six years.
Eight years, down in Guadalupe.
He was facing 25 years.
Didn't do a single day.
That's why he calls me the "Magic Man."
I asked him not to call me that,
but he insists. Heh, heh. Next!
Number one on the speed dial,
that's your lifeline.
Cops pick you up, threaten you,
look at you sideways,
you press that button and I'm there.

Would you comment on
the latest development?
The Graven what?
People are saying
you're prosecuting an innocent man.
Does the DA's Office
have something to hide?
- Well, um...
- Excuse me, excuse me.
Please let me through. Uh...
That's my client you're talking about.
- And you are?
- I'm Saul Goodman.
And Carl Gravenhorst is
100 percent innocent.
The Albuquerque DA's Office
is perpetrating
an outrageous miscarriage of justice.
- You're who?
- I'm Saul Goodman,
and we are counter-suing you
and the entire Albuquerque DA's Office
for malicious persecution,
unlawful detention
and abuse of process.
Seriously?
Yeah. We'll take this all the way
to the Supreme Court.
By the time we're through,
Carl Gravenhorst's name will be cleared
and we'll receive a settlement.
A cash settlement.
All right, enough.
I've got to be in court.
Go if you must. But know this:
We will meet again.
DRAMA GIRL:
I'm sorry. What'd you say your name was?
I'm Saul Goodman,
and I make it my business
to defend the citizens of Albuquerque
against injustices of every kind.
- Wow, you must be really expensive though.
- Not at all.
I believe every man, woman
and child deserves speedy justice
at a price they can afford.
Do you have a card?
Not for me. For a friend.
Yes. And please tell your friend
that, uh, I make no judgements
and I'm available 24 hours a day.
- Can I get one of those, sir?
- Oh, yeah.
- What about me?
- Oh, sure.
Okay. Wow.
Yeah, I, uh...
I just don't know.
Five months.
With overcrowding,
you'll probably do less than two.
Yeah. Yeah.
Considering your priors,
sentencing guidelines
would have you looking
at two to four years in custody, so...
Five months is really good, Bobby.
Are you worried about being there
when Lois delivers?
Delivers?
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, so, um...
So if I go to trial,
you'll be my lawyer, right?
- Bobby, you do not want to go to trial.
- But you'll be my lawyer?
Yes, but going to trial
would be a mistake.
Trials are always unpredictable.
At trial,
the DA will throw everything at us.
- You'll be rolling the dice.
- Yeah, roll the dice.
Yeah, I don't mean to tell you
your business, Miss Wexler,
but you put me up there,
I give the people the big eyes,
they see Lois here and the kid.
- They're gonna believe me.
- I'd believe you.
Bobby, there are a million reasons
not to go to trial.
But it's up to me, right?
Yes, it is, but I'm advising you not to.
Odds are, you would end up going away
for more time, not less.
And I'm talking about years of your life.
But I might not. Right?
- You don't want to take that risk.
- Maybe I do.
Lois?
Whatever Bobby says.

thanking you.
I'm trying to talk him out of trial.
No! Seriously?
Seriously.
You know what?
[KIM SIGHS]
No.
No, we can fix this.
I'm from the DA's Office, okay?
I'm giving you what for.
You're giving me what for. We'll be loud.
We will go over there,
we will make a scene, okay? Uh...
New evidence has come to light,
and I'm pulling his deal
with extreme prejudice.
I'm pissed!
I want to put him away permanently.
[VIDEO GAME BEEPING]
They're talking about you.
[JIMMY SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
You fight me, I will push back hard.
We'll have that punk on his knees,
begging for the five months.
- I don't think so.
- Come on, Kim. We can do this.
- Lead-pipe cinch.
- He's the client, it's his decision.
What good is it gonna do,
you put that dweeb away in Los Lunas? Huh?
You think he's a jackass now?
Wait till he gets back
from that clown college.
Jimmy, uh, no.
What about his wife and kid?
That's them? What about them?
If this isn't using our powers for good,
I don't know what is.
- We're not doing that.
- But, Kim, we could do it!
- I'm not scamming my client.
- It worked for Mesa Verde.
Jimmy. Back off.
We can't...
Okay.
[SCOFFS]
Um...
Yeah, I'll see you at home.
So...
who was that?
Is everything all right?
He's from the District Attorney's Office.
They're taking the deal off the table.
So what? I mean, we weren't
gonna take it anyway, so...
Miss Wexler,
why are they taking it off the table?
I...
don't know for sure.
It's possible they have new evidence.
Like... Like what?
Like cameras or witnesses? Or...?
I really couldn't say.
We'll find out soon enough.
Bobby, I'm sorry.
It looks like they want
to make an example out of you.
Uh...
All right, well...
We better go tell the judge
that we're taking this to trial.
Yeah, you know what? Um...
Are you sure
we still can't get the five months?
The DA took that off the table.
You mean if you...
Even if you ask real nice?
I could try.
- Are you sure that's what you want?
- Yeah, I thought about it,
just like you said, and...
I could do the five months.
Miss Wexler, please.
[KIM EXHALES SHARPLY]
Wait here.
I can't promise anything, but...
- I'll look into it.
- Sure, sure.
You do that.
We'll be right here.
