- He wants out.
- Varga stays.
I quit Schweikart and Cokely.
- Wait. What?
- To help people who are actually in need.
Put your phone down. Leave it on.
What did you do, Saul?
If you don't trust your
men with your money,
you have bigger problems than
if you trust Saul Goodman.
Come on, Ignacio, go.
We got a long way ahead of us.
Hey. Did you hear all that?
I heard enough to
know she saved your ass.






So... ?
So what happens next?
We'll see.
Who was that?
Uh, that was, um...
It's the guy who saved my life.
Kim, I got the money.
I was on my way back...
I thought I was home free...
And I was ambushed,
by, uh, like, a gang.
A... A cartel gang.
And they... they took the money,
and one of them...
put a gun to my head.






And that guy on the phone... ?
He showed up.
He... He shot 'em with a sniper rifle.
He... killed all of them.
All but one.
One guy got away.
And later, I helped him
to get that one, too.
Kim, I...
Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I think we should get outta here.
Kind of assumed we'd
be staying at a Motel 6
or the nail salon.
B-Better to have more people around.
How're your shoulders?
Should I put something on them,
or would that just make it worse?
I think I'm, uh...
Am I bad for you?
Are you "bad for me"?
I got you into this.
What happened tonight...
None of this would have happened
if you weren't with me.
You crossed a line.
You're not gonna do it again.
Yeah.
It's been a long day.
Come on. Make room.
Mm.
Good night.
Well?
He went over the border and kept going.
Looks to be headed for
his place in Chihuahua.
And he should be there in a few hours.
Good.
There's a wrinkle.
He took Varga with him.
Why?
Well, if he thought Varga
was working for you,
he'd have killed him on the spot.
If I had to guess,
I'd say Varga's up for a promotion.
Can you communicate with Varga?
Salamanca's place is in
the middle of nowhere.
Landlines and sat phones only.
A technical issue.
The way things stand,
he's gonna get caught in the crossfire.
I'm thinking we should find a way
to pull him out of there.
And tip our hand?
He's earned some consideration.
Does Varga know
there's going to be an assassination?
No one's told him...
but he can make a
pretty damn good guess.
Perhaps...
there is a way to make
use of this situation.
The men I've chosen for
this are highly skilled.
They're the best in the their business.
But the one thing they do not have...
is a man on the inside.
Mi Yolis! Como estas?
Quien te quiere?
Te ves flaco.
No había nada comer allá.
¿Cecilio, cómo estás, amigo?
Patrón...
Ah.
Nachito, come on over, huh?
Don't be shy.
These... These are my people.
Yolanda... she is the best
cook in all of Chihua...
you're gonna eat like you have
never eaten before in your life.
Cecilio... he takes care
of all of my gardens...
His tomatoes are the best ever, eh?
Ciro, Miguel, Gerardo, Raúl,
and all the rest of these fools...
they're supposed to
be guarding this place,
but, uh, I just keep 'em around
because they're so pretty, right?
Ah.
Eh?
Hey, listen.
Welcome. Smile.
You're in my house, man.
Come on. Come in.
Mnh.
Hey, did you pack
anything with aloe in it?
Oh. Mornin'.
Morning.
- I didn't wake you, did I?
- No.
- Uh, you're going to court?
- Yeah.
I have a hearing at 10:00,
and I want to see if I can catch Oakley
before I go in.
You seemed like you could use the sleep.
Yeah.
Hey, I think I might have a better idea.
What if we spend the
whole day here, you know?
Uh, this place has got everything.
It's got a heated pool,
a swim-up bar, a hot tub.
Well, I didn't pack a swimsuit.
Neither did I.
Th-There's a shop downstairs.
And... And... And we can
stop in at the spa, you know,
a-and get couples massages.
With your sunburn?
Yeah.
Or, um, or a "seaweed wrap", you know,
and then... then we'll just go hang
in the co-ed sauna, you know,
- sweat out some toxins and, uh...
- Mm.
Oh!
24-hour room service.
Hey, what could be more luxurious
than to spend a whole
day being totally pampered
and end it all with a
midnight cheeseburger?
Come on. Hey, don't we deserve this?
Jimmy, I-I-I have clients.
Yeah.
You... You just quit Schweikart.
I mean, take one day off.
The clerks love you.
They will give you a
continuance on anything.
Hey, Kim, we already
sprang for this place.
I'm just sayin' let's take advantage.
You know, let's John
and Yoko this sucker.
You don't think it's safe?
Probably, it is.
But here's the thing.
L-Lalo has guys, right?
So it doesn't really
matter where he is...
if he finds one loose end,
all it takes is a phone call.
Do you know something
you're not telling me?
No. No, I don't.
But what's the harm in
being a little cautious?
What about tomorrow?
And the next day?
Jimmy, what about next week?
I don't know.
Alright.
Then, the way I see it,
we just need to keep our eyes open
and get on with our lives.
- Kim, listen...
- The courthouse...
it's... it's three blocks from here.
It's full of cops...
police headquarters is right next door.
Jimmy...
it's gonna be fine.
I'll see you later.
Hey, it's me. I want an update.
Bullshit.
I want to know what's going on.
Not good enough.
No. You know what?
Y'know what... We are...
We are gonna talk about this
face-to-face.
You tell me where you are.
I will come to...
Hello?
That means we won.
The state dropped the charges.
No, no, no.
You don't have to appear in court again.
Now we both have the morning off.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry, Mira... you know what?
I have to go.
But call if you have
any questions, any time.
Okay. Yes, bye.
Hey, Grant.
You got a minute?
How's it going?
Uh, let's see.
I have half an hour to
plead out four taggers
and a homeless guy who tried to stuff
a dozen hardboiled eggs down
his pants at a Ruby Tuesday's.
Life in the Public Defender's office.
How's your day so far?
Uh, I've got some holes in
my schedule I'm lookin' to fill.
Holes? You tellin' me
you're billin'... what?
Two-fifty an hour?
And you've got holes in your schedule?
If I were you, I'd keep things airtight.
I'd like some more PD overflow.
Go talk to the contract liaison.
And Gloria'll set you up.
Alright, the thing is,
I know I'm not supposed
to choose the cases I get,
but I'm looking for
something... specific.
Specific?
Like what?
Uh, uh.
I just want to make sure
I'm spending my time
where it'll do the most good.
I gotcha.
So plain old indigent's
not good enough for you?
You want the clients that'll
get you, you know, in here.
Grant, just let me
have some tricky ones.
Think of all the extra time you'll have
to spend on your egg stuffers.
If I were going to go along with that,
- you'd have to take felonies.
- Sure.
We're talking cases that
are headed for trial.
Nothing you can plead
out in three hot minutes
with your friendly neighborhood ADA.
I'll take 20.
Today.
20?
That's your offer?
20 felonies?
Yes.
Hold this.
Come on.
Hey, Dana!
Any chance you can tell the judge
I'm running 15 minutes late?
Oh. Gotta warn you, right now,
we're backed up like an
outhouse at Woodstock.
So, possession raps are here...
Possession with intent...
These are all assault...
wait, no...
assault's on the other
side of this shelf.
All of these cases are pending?
Pretty much.
Had more burnouts than
usual this last quarter.
That's what I call taking
that private firm gig,
gettin' that sweet company car,
burnin' rubber on your way out.
Public intoxication, petty larceny,
destruction of property,
DUI, trespassing...
Involuntary manslaughter,
immigration, domestic violence...
Or, if you feel like you do want...
Juveniles.
Go ahead and have a look around.
Let me know which ones you
want so we can kick 'em over.
I'll getchu a box.
Flashlight.
When you talk to the
boss, you call him Don.
He asks you a question,
you tell the truth,
fewest words... you can.
If he likes you, he's gonna
give you a bump up.
Hey, don't think I don't see you, eh?
I see you. I do.
Right now, steady is
what we need, you know?
What if he doesn't like me?
Ah, you'll be fine.
Gimme the socket wrench.
- Um. I gotta hit the head.
- Yeah, yeah.
Hey, don't get any
grease on my sink, eh?
Yeah.
After that, I want you
both to be thinking about
how to parse out discovery.
It's gonna be document heavy,
so let's be mindful
of resource management.
Howard.
Kim. Good to see you.
- Uh, what floor?
- Three, please.
Have you met my associates,
Paul Shepard and Michelle Avila?
- I don't think so. Hi.
- Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Uh, guys, this is Kim Wexler.
She's an HHM alum
and now heads up banking
at Schweikart and Cokely.
Nice to meet you both.
I'm actually not at Schweikart anymore.
Or in banking, for that matter.
Really?
As of yesterday.
Take care, Howard.
Kim, Kim!
Hang on a sec!
Out of curiosity, where'd you land?
Reeves and Green?
I'm out on my own again.
Rich let you go?
It wasn't up to him. I left.
What about Mesa Verde?
I advised them to stay with Schweikart.
Um. I know it's a
personal question, Kim,
- but can I ask why?
- That is personal.
- And I have a busy day, so...
- Spare me a minute.
Please.
It's important.
What's up?
I wasn't going to say anything.
Last time I tried to get
something off my chest,
it didn't go very well.
I just think
before you make any big
changes in your life,
there's something about
Jimmy you ought to hear.
Okay.
A little while ago, I offered
Jimmy a job at HHM.
I'm guessing he didn't
mention it to you.
He said he had to think about it.
But then, the very next night,
he threw bowling balls
over my front gate.
Bowling balls?
Someone could've been really hurt.
More or less destroyed my car.
Then, a couple of weeks later,
I'm having lunch with Cliff Main,
and I'm accosted by two prostitutes.
Actual prostitutes.
Jimmy had sent them to make a scene.
I confronted Jimmy about it,
and after some hemming and hawing,
he all but confessed.
- And that's it?
- Mm-hmm.
Sorry.
Ah.
Howard, you really...
you... you really had me going there.
Laugh if you want,
but no person in their right mind
would behave the way Jimmy has.
We are talking about someone
who's not in control of himself.
You and I both know it makes no sense
to drop a client like Mesa Verde,
and I gotta think Jimmy had
something to do with that.
Do you have any idea
how insulting that is?
I make my own decisions,
for my own reasons.
You gotta listen to me.
The man needs help.
Howard, I know Jimmy, and you're wrong.
You know who really knew Jimmy?
Chuck.
Open up, asshole!
Open this door!
I want to talk to you!
What? Huh?
You didn't think I'd find
your ultra secret bat cave?
Well, the joke's on you, sucker!
I'm your attorney,
and you will let me in!
I'm not goin' anywhere!
I mean it!
I got nowhere to be!
Open. Up. Now!
Hey!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Ah, there he is!
Not... Not a fan of the
surprise pop-in, huh?
- Well, I can't imagine why!
- You keep it down.
- I got neighbors.
- I will not keep it down.
I want answers, okay?
The time has come for
you to level with me,
and I'm not going to leave until you do.
Inside, now.
Okay, look, look.
Okay.
Y-You saved my life.
Thank you for that.
But from here on out,
I gotta be kept in the loop, man.
It's not my fault that I got ambushed.
Why did I have to lie
to Salamanca about that?
Who was I lying for?
Now, you gotta tell me
what is happening now!
- That's not your concern.
- Oh, come on!
Listen to me... you
are not blowing me off
with any "that's not the
end of the story" crap!
Now, just specifics!
You're asking for
information you can't have.
If anything happens to her...
I can't do this.
I can't.
Hm. Hm.
Alright.
Alright.
Now, you listen, and you shut up.
This man has other things on his mind.
He's not thinking about you.
Lalo Salamanca is going to die.
Tonight.
Tonight... ?
This time tomorrow, it'll be done.
Oh. Okay, then...
Now... I need you to leave.
I have family coming over.
Charlie Manson!
Don Eladio.
Bolsa.
Hey.
- Ah.
- Hmm.
- Excelente.
- Sí.
Mm. Hm.
Ooh. I "Magnum, P.I."!
¿Eh, Bolsa?
Sí.
Don.
Ah.
"Frunk".
Oh.
Oiga, Don Eladio...
Ah.
Ah.
Entonces...
Mm.
Ah.
Bikers?
Hm.
Don Eladio...
Mm-hmm.
Ignacio Varga...
Mm.
Salud.
Really?
Really.
How do you know?
I talked to my guy.
Lalo's in Mexico, and
he's stayin' there.
But you said he might call someone...
He's not gonna do that.
Your "guy", h-how does he know for sure?
He's not gonna tell me, but he knows.
And you believe him?
Yeah, I do.
So... we're safe?
Yeah.
My God.
Oh, my God.
That's great.
It's great, right?
So what's wrong?
It's... It's over.
This time.
There's not gonna be a next time.
Kim...
... it's been a rough ride.
I've been thinking a lot,
and, um...
we should probably just
check out and go home.
I-I, uh, packed my stuff.
I think I got yours, too.
And double-check.
We already paid for the night.
What about the spa and all that?
We haven't even tried room service.
Kim, don't you just want to go home?
"A veil of white cheddar
draped over coarse-ground
Angus beef patty,
locally grown chili pepper,
house baked sesame-seed bun,
served with golden-brown
shoestring potatoes
seasoned with truffle salt".
Truffle salt.
I'm hungry, Jimmy.
and there is nothing to
eat at home, anyway, so...
why not?
♪ Well, it ain't nobody's business ♪
♪ Oh, yeah ♪
So, I ran into Howard
at the courthouse today.
Yeah?
Told me something about
bowling balls destroying his car.
Prostitutes harassing him at lunch...
♪ To jump into the ocean ♪
For what it's worth,
that all happened before we...
Before we got married?
Yeah.
You know why Hamlin told me all that?
It was for "my own good".
Like... Like I'm just waiting for him
to ride up on his white horse.
It's...
I-It's... It's all about him...
it's always all about him.
The guy is in love with himself.
He needed to be taken down a peg.
So...
what's next?
You went after his car.
You went after his reputation. So...
I think maybe the next thing is...
his hair, right?
Suppose... and I'm... I'm
just brainstorming here...
but suppose we slip him a mickey,
and then, while he's out,
we get out the old electric clippers...
zzzzzt...
shave him bald.
Nair.
What?
It's an old gag, but, um...
sneak into his country club
and put Nair in his shampoo bottle.
Then he takes a shower, and...
Hair falls out.
- Yeah.
- Nice.
Or... Or... Or, um,
we pour a barrel of chlorine
into his swimming pool,
- so that...
- Bleaches his hair and his eyebrows
- and everything.
- Yes, yes, and the eyebrows.
Or... Or...
Or we break into his house,
replace all the fluffy
toilet-paper rolls
- with single-ply.
- Ouch.
Hit him where he lives.
Or whatever tanning lotion he uses...
we replace it with sunblock.
He gets in his tanning bed,
and waste of time.
Or... Or...
Or what?
We'd never do it, but...
Never do what?
What if...
What if Howard does something terrible?
Like he murders a waiter
for putting butter
on his cauliflower... ?
No, I mean really bad.
Like misconduct.
You know, misappropriating funds
and, um, bribing witnesses...
something like that.
You know what that'd mean
for the Sandpiper case?
A big class action suit?
It could tank the whole thing.
Cliff Main's hair would be on fire.
He'd get it settled.
Pronto.
He would?
Yeah.
Think about how much
they've put into that case.
Almost two years of work.
If it fell apart now,
they'd get nothing.
So, yeah.
Cliff Main would take whatever
Sandpiper was offering.
I already tried like hell
to get Sandpiper settled.
Yeah, but you went about it wrong.
Sorry, but... this is how you do it.
And it's not like the
old folks'd get stiffed.
If Sandpiper settled now,
they might each get 15, 20 bucks less,
but they'd get their money now,
while they can still use it.
And the lawyers get paid.
And the lawyers get paid.
How much of the common fund do you get?
We get 20% of the common fund.
I'm just... I'm...
Forget it, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
Have a seat.
Hey, you did good today, huh?
Tomorrow, I'll show you around. Mm.
When you go back up north...
you're gonna be halfway
to being a Salamanca, eh?
Thanks.
Ah.
Another night owl, huh? You don't sleep?
Mnh-mnh.
Not tonight.
Yeah, I never sleep much.
An hour, maybe two.
It's enough.
When it's like this?
That's when I can think.
I get my best ideas when
everybody else is asleep.
Some people... they call it a curse.
I like it.
I don't know.
I'd rather get some shuteye.
And yet, here we are.
Got anything stronger?
Now you're talking.
In the bar, bottom shelf, decanter.
That's the good stuff.
Two glasses.
There he is!
I thought you got lost.
Ah.
You ever had Louis XIII?
I don't think so.
Ooph. You're in for a treat.
To sleep and those who need it.
To sleep.
What the hell is that?
These morons have no respect!
iCiro!
Ah!
iCiro!
iCiro!
Ciro, Ciro.
Ah!
Ah.
What do you want?
I'll have a little of everything.
Actually, leave off the mint chip.
I set the alarm for 6:00.
Since we have to check out
and go home before work.
That's a solid 2 and a half hours.
Sounds good.
So, what would you do with it?
I don't know.
What would you?
I'd hire Stef away from Schweikart.
I'd hire Bruce from HHM.
I'd get Viola.
I'd rent the smallest, shittiest office
I could find near the courthouse
and open a pro bono practice.
Give regular people the
kind of representation
usually only millionaires get.
I was gonna say we'd buy a house.
Sorry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We could do both.
Last I heard,
Sandpiper was willing
to go to $26 million.
Wow.
Um, a third of that is $8.5 million.
Mm-hmm. And 20% of that is...
Around $2 mil.
Ah, but it's not happening.
Come on, Kim.
We're not talking
about a bar trick here.
We're talking about scorched earth.
We would have to hurt him.
Hurt him bad.
To get a bunch of lawyers
to run for the exits?
Howard would have to have
done something... unforgivable.
At the end of it,
he might never be able
to practice law again.
Ah, he doesn't deserve that.
And who knows if we could pull it off?
Okay, maybe we could pull it off, yeah.
But we won't.
We're talking about a career setback.
A career setback for one lawyer.
Yeah, and you could
help a lot of people.
I-I get it, but...
Kim, doing this, that...
It's not you.
Okay?
You would not be okay with it.
Not in the cold light of day.
Wouldn't I?
I'm gonna go take a shower
so I don't have to in the morning.
Kim, you're shittin' me, right?
P-chew! P-chew!
Bien.
Bien.
Bien. Bien, bien, bien, bien.
