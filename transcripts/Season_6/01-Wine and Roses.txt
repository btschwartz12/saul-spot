get out of here.
He took Varga with him.
We should find a way
to pull him out of there.






He's earned some consideration.
He's a man on the inside.
Our actions
must be unimpeachable.
Lalo Salamanca is going to die.
So we're safe?
Yeah.
[Exhales sharply]
[Gunshot]
[Rapid gunfire]
What if Howard does something
terrible, like misconduct?
You know what that'd mean
for Sandpiper?
You could help a lot of people.
I-I get it.
But you would not
be okay with it.
Wouldn't I?

Good morning, Don Juan.
Lalo Salamanca is dead.
Gunmen broke into his hacienda
last night.
Hired operators
from the look of it.
It was messy.
Very messy.
As for the Salamancas...
"Sangre por sangre."
Yes.
That is the Salamanca way.
We are on the verge of chaos.
But who did this?
One minute, I hear talk
of the Colombians,
the next... traitors.
Traitors close to home.
We know this much.
Ignacio Varga is a rat.
Don Eladio has put a price
on his head.
Every man we have
is searching for him.
When Varga's found, we'll know
who he was working for.
I assume Don Hector
has been told.
I called him myself.
As for if he understood me,
quién sabe.
Listen to me.
You must be careful, Gustavo.
This is a dangerous time.
No one is above suspicion.
I understand.
Good.
[Line disconnects]
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
Gus: Tell me again
about the sicario
who made the final report.
He was already wounded
when he talked to our cut-out.
Federales found him
dead at the scene.
But they got Salamanca.
The mercenaries are dead.
To a man.
And yet their mission
was a success.
It has been known to happen.
I could go down there and
get Varga, bring him home safe.
There's ways to do it
on the quiet.
[Sighs, clears throat]
Unless you already have
something in the works.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
Speak your mind.
Loyalty goes both ways.
Varga has done everything
you asked him.
He wasn't given a choice. Maybe so.
But he played a tough game
and he played it on the square.
And?
When all is said and done...
The kid deserves your respect.
[Inhales deeply]
He has it.
Is there more you wish to say?
[Door opens]
[Door closes]

I hope this brings your guy
more luck than it brought me.
You good?
I'm great.

Miss Khalil.
Good morning.
I've been calling you
for two days.
Oh.
My girl's out sick.
What can I do you for?
Tomorrow morning.
10:00 a.m.
Brunch?
With just you and me, right?
I mean, won't the big fella here
feel like a third wheel?
You and I are meeting Parson
in chambers.
I am asking
for an emergency hearing
to alter the terms
of De Guzman's release.
[Chuckles]
Sounds like a blast.
Unfortunately, I'm booked solid.
I checked your client's
place of residence.
The address he gave?
It's a Dairy Queen
in Alta Monte.
The family that showed at the
bail hearing can't be located.
No driver's license,
no tax rolls,
no school records.
Nothing.
Fact is, there isn't
a single Elizabeth McKinnon
under the age of 73
living in New Mexico.
Well, this is...
This is surprising.
Your client has disappeared,
and I'm not waiting six weeks
to start looking for him.
Hey, my guy put up
seven million in bail.
You think he's just
gonna walk away from that?
Who comes up with
seven million bucks in cash?
You know what I think?
I think the family was fake,
and I think you knew it
the whole time.
Hold on. Look, just get real
for a second.
The hearing didn't go your way,
and now you're trying
for a do-over.
You say my guy ran?
I say he's got seven million
reasons for showing up...
When he's legally required
to do so.
So, no,
I won't be, uh,
due process window dressing
at any crash meeting
with Parson.
And if you try throwing
any of this crap around
in front the judge
without my presence...
Here's an accusation.
Prosecutorial misconduct.
Career-ending
prosecutorial misconduct.
[Scoffs]None of that changes the fact
the guy's not
who he said he was. No, no, no. Hold on.
You guys got caught with
your pants around your ankles
and somehow that's on me?
I don't think so.
You've got two dozen lawyers
up there,
you got investigators, you got
the whole damn police force...
And it's my fault
you can't keep track of Lalo?
That is not my job!
Lalo?
Who's Lalo?
What?
What did I say?
[Sighs]
I meant De Guzman.
I have more than one client.
[Chuckles]
So [Clears throat]
I will see you at
the preliminary in six weeks.
As scheduled.
Until then,
