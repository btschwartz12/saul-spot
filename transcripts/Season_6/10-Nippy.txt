We're... We're done.
Marion: Gene?
Hey, Gene, I see your car!
Gene?
[Clears throat]
Gene:
Well, that's a start.
Looks like your problem
is the master cylinder.
Look at you boys, hard at work.
[Sighs] Well, Marion, guys,
I got to get going.
I will take another look
next time.
Wait a minute.
No, you can't go anywhere
looking like that.
Come on inside and wash up.
Ma...
Jeffie, don't vex me.
Come on, Gene.
You can help me
with the groceries.
Huh, Gene? Sounds like a plan.
[Water running]
Marion: Nice of you to
help Jeffie with his car.
You might not know it, but
my boy's had some tough times.
He, uh... He fell in with
a bad crowd back in Albuquerque.
Albuquerque, huh?
Never been.
Lucky you.
But things are so much better
for Jeffie here.
Even more so
now that he knows you.
You're a good influence, Gene.
Oh, where's my brain?
I keep forgetting to ask you
about Nippy.
Nippy?
Oh, oh, right.
You're not gonna believe this,
but, uh, he was with a family
the whole time, just...
Just a few blocks away.
Oh, well, that's wonderful!
Yeah.
He's in great shape.
So, after all that...
a happy ending.
Oh, well...
Here you go, Ma'am.
Thanks.
And looky here.
For you, m'lady. Thank you.
Hey, Gene,
aren't you taking lunch?
Huh?
[Sighs]
Thanks.

You get over it, okay?
Please, believe me.
Before you know it,
you'll forget all about it.
Go.
