please just say the word.
There is something,
actually.
You two were the last ones
to see him, weren't you?
Um...
I guess so.
Um, that's what
the police said.
Howard told me
that you were harassing him.
Playing elaborate pranks
of some sort.
That you wouldn't
leave him alone.
I know
he thought that.
H-He told me,
as well.
Um, I think
he honestly believed it.
But you're denying it.
You know what?
[Clears throat]
I didn't leave here
under the best, uh, terms.
The past few years,
I could have, uh,
been more considerate
to Howard
instead of yitzing him
every chance I got.
I guess, uh...
there was a certain amount
of jealousy on my part
because Howard had the, uh,
respect of my brother.
Which I never did.
Tell me what you told
the police.
Okay. Um [clears throat] well,
I mean, it was 11:00 P.M.
Howard started
pounding on our door.
He was very upset,
going on about something,
uh, he thought
was my fault.
Uh, I guess it had to do
with the Sandpiper case,
but I-I couldn't make
head or tail out of it.
We tried
to calm him down...
but he just...
he just wouldn't.
Um...
Finally, he left.
That... That's it.
I'm not oblivious.
I know people are saying
he was on drugs.
Is that what
you're trying to tell me?
It just...
He just didn't
seem like himself.
Are you hearing
all of this?
Because none of it
makes sense to me.
Main: Cheryl,
maybe we should just...
I don't care
what people are saying.
I don't care
what the police think.
Howard was not on drugs.
That simply is not true.
There's something more
to this.
I don't know
if it's my place,
but...
I... I...
Please...
just spit it out.
[Sighs]
It was about
a year and a half ago.
I was still
an associate here.
Working late on a brief.
And I saw a light on
in Howard's office.
I assumed the cleaning crew
left it on by mistake.
And I was sure the office
was empty, so I didn't knock...
And?
[Sighs]
And Howard was there
at his desk,
head down,
and he was snorting
something.
[Scoffs]
I looked at him.
He looked at me.
I didn't know what to do,
so I just walked out.
And the next morning
when we saw each other,
neither of us said
anything about it.
I never told anyone...
...but now I wish I had.
In all the years
that you worked with him,
have you witnessed
anything like this?
Even a hint?
Cliff?
I...
Cheryl, this really isn't
the time or the place.
Cheryl,
you were his wife.
You... You saw him every day,
you knew him better than anyone.
Maybe I misunderstood
what I saw...
You would have known.

Bailiff: All rise.
Court is now in session.
The Honorable Judge Dearden
presiding.
Good afternoon.
We are here to discuss
a motion to exclude evidence
in State of New Mexico
v. Yarborough.
Your Honor,
if I may?
I submitted
an additional motion.
I'm assuming
you have not seen it yet.
Did we get that?It just came in,
Judge.
I apologize.
It was a last minute addition.
Last minute is right.
Do I understand this
correctly?
You're requesting to withdraw
from this case?
Yes, Your Honor.
My client
is fully informed
and I've already been in touch
with another attorney.
Paige Novick.
She's highly qualified
and familiar with the case.
She's prepared to step in,
if you'll allow it.
Ms. Wexler, Mr. Orenstein,
approach the bench.
Ms. Wexler, we are here today
at your insistence,
to consider your motion,
to exclude evidence.
And this is the moment
you choose to withdraw?
It was unavoidable.
May I ask why?
Personal reasons,
Your Honor.
Personal reasons.
Are we talking about
a health issue?
Something to do with
a loved one?
No.
Would you rather discuss this
privately in chambers?
Thank you
for the consideration...
but no.
Would you care to supply
any detail at all?
Your Honor,
I'd prefer not to.
[Sighs]
Mr. Orenstein,
is the state prepared
to discuss Ms. Wexler's motion?
We are, Your Honor.
Absolutely.
You know what,
Ms. Wexler?
Mr. Orenstein is here.
I'm here.
We all showed up
for your party
and now you're taking away
the punchbowl?
I'm inclined to have you
argue your motion
and then I'll consider
late-arriving petitions.
I'm sorry for wasting
the court's time, Your Honor,
but it's impossible for me
to continue with this hearing.
And why is that,
Ms. Wexler?
Because I'm no longer
an attorney.
I'm sorry? What?
I gave notice to the bar
two hours ago.

throw everything away.

Wh... uh, what about
your clients, huh?
What about, uh, that poor guy,
uh, Mr. Yarborough?
What about the kid
in foster care?
Huh? You give them
everything you've got.
Who are they gonna find
who's half as good as you?
No one!
They need you.
It's already done.Ugh!
[Sniffles]
Okay.
What's done can be undone.
All I'm saying is
just... just...
let's take a week or two
to think it over.
For now, we're gonna take
some time off.
God knows we need it.
We're gonna find a new place.
We're gonna leave here.
We're never, ever gonna
come back here again, okay?
We're gonna...
We're gonna put it behind us.
Things will look brighter.
I guarantee it.
But first,
we have to fix this.
So we're gonna go back
to the hotel room,
and you're gonna
write letters.
You're gonna write a letter
to the bar.
You're gonna write letters
to your clients.
Y-You... You dictate.
I will type.
We're gonna roll
this thing back.
I'll order a pizza.
We'll pull an all-nighter
because we're in this
together, okay?
So, I'm gonna go get
your... your printer
and then we're gonna get
the hell out of here.
Look, Jimmy...
J-Jimmy...

of my life with you.
But we are bad
for everyone around us.

because of us.

but together...
we're poison.
No. No.
Just tell me
what I need to do
to change, okay?
Just tell me what it is
and I'll do it.
Jimmy.
No, Kim.
You make me happy.
We make each other happy.
How can that be bad?
Hey.
I love you.
I love you, too.

But so what?
No. No.
No, Kim, you're wrong!
This is about Howard!
Okay? What happened to him
wasn't on us.
It wasn't your fault.
It wasn't my fault!
It was that fucking
Lalo Salamanca!
That psychopath came back
from the dead
and he walked
through that door!
He did this.
Not us. Him.
I knew.
You knew wh-what?
I knew he was alive.
No, you didn't.
It was about a month ago.
I saw that car
following me again.

both of us.

that Lalo was alive...
...and you didn't tell me?

I thought it was
a one in a million chance
that he'd come for us.
I thought he would be caught
if he did.
And I told myself
I was protecting you.
But that's not the truth.
The...

I didn't tell you
was because
I knew what you'd do.

You'd fear for me.

to run and hide
