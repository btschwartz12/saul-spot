Wasn't that...Howard?
The word is out! I need a new
place to do business pronto.
Might be a diamond in the rough.
Lalo Salamanca
is dead.
He...isn't.
Most likely
he'll know who to reach out,
he's got bigger fish to fry.
All due respect, the rest of the
world thinks the guy is dead.
Lalo, he's alive.
And where is he?

Everything okay?

We are currently in the middle
of a process called "discovery."
What is "discovery,"
you might ask?
It's one of the most important
parts of any case
because it's when both parties
are able to "discover,"
if you will,
information that is relevant
to the claims at issue.
Now this brings us to another
key term... "relevance."
If a document or a piece
of evidence is "relevant,"
that means it has a tendency
to prove... or disprove...
an element in the case.
This whole thing is just
takin' so darn long.
Unfortunately, high-stakes
class actions like these
often move on
a protracted timeline.
Well, okay,
but some of us don't have
a "protracted timeline,"
if you know what I mean.
Right?
My son thinks I should
get my own lawyer.
You have every right
to pursue
independent
legal representation.
- Having said that...
- Uh, absolutely.
It's great to see
the next generation stepping up,
isn't it?
Thank you, Ms. Brill.
Hi, everyone. I'm so glad
to be with you today.
For those of you
who don't know me yet,
I'm your lead attorney...
Howard Hamlin.
Just call me Howard.
And this is my co-counsel,
Cliff Main.
Listen. I know you all want
to get to the finish line.
Boy, I-I sure do.
But I'm gonna level with you.
Truth is,
we still have a ways to go.
Why? Because we want
the maximum from Sandpiper.
We're pushing to get an extra
30% on top of the penalty.
Uh, not because
we're greedy, no.
Because it's what you deserve.
Now, to get your due,
it may take a little extra time.
Is it worth it?
I think it is.
Because this isn't
just about money.
It's about people.
It's about you.
Sally, right?
Right. Sally.
And you, sir.
We're sending a message...
we're not gonna let
big corporations
pick the pockets
of hard-working folks.
I-I want to live in a world
where people
can trust each other.
And I bet you do, too.
Thanks again, both of you.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.
Oh, I feel better.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Bye.
Okay.
Bye, now.
Thank you.
You take care.
Well, I think we just
put out a major fire.
That was impressive.
Erin, I'll see you
back at the office.
Okay. Bye, Howard.
Howard...
Bye.
...I need a minute.
What's up?
I threw a woman
out of my car.
In the middle
of the street.
And I... Zip, I just drive
right past ya...
That's what you're saying.
No, I-I don't even...
I don't know
how to respond to that.
I'm not asking you
to respond.
I just need you to know
that I know.
It wasn't me, Cliff.
Whoever you think you saw...
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the
kinda thing my son used to say.
It was your Jaguar,
your "Namaste" plate.
It was you!
Howard, there's no harm
in asking for help.
You got a lot of people
in your corner.
So, there's the... the baggie
at the country club.
Yes.
After that, some clients...
who you can't name because of
privilege... make insinuations.
Then, on Thursday,
you have a business meeting,
and you witness a Jaguar
speeding past.
Who were you meeting with?
I'm not sure why that's germane,
but...Kim Wexler.
She came to me
for career advice.
Alright.
Okay.
Of course.
Of course.
Cliff, I know
this wasn't easy for you.
You came to me as a friend.
I appreciate it.
You can start today, Howard.
Oh, I will.
Because you're right.
I do have a problem.
Just not the problem
you think.
I have a Jimmy McGill
problem.
J-Jimmy McGill?
You'll have to excuse me.

Me. Just me.
For now.

half the work.

What happened to the old folks?
Elder law?
Uh, I expanded the mission,

Here at Saul Goodman

we welcome all ages,

Saul Goodman?
You?

No! Whatever's more.

Well, then,

I'm glad you called.
Um, I've been wanting

Everyone was so shocked
