Your Honor, the defense has made
the very reasonable request
that the plaintiffs produce their medical records,
or barring that,
a signed HIPAA release so that we
can examine the records ourselves.
Your Honor, our clients' medical records
have no bearing on the merits of this case.
The medical records are plainly relevant
as they bear directly on our contention
that the plaintiffs are not
adequate class representatives.
This is a transparent attempt
at intimidation, nothing more.
How so?
Many of our clients have information
in their medical records
that they prefer to keep private.
They're fearful, as any of us would be,
at the thought of a bunch of strangers
poking around in their personal files.
And by forcing them to reveal this information,
the defense is banking on them
simply dropping out of the case.
Your Honor, this is about class certification.
That's all.
If the named plaintiffs are suffering from
dementia or other mental deficiencies...
You're saying they're incompetent?
I'm saying we have a right to any record
that would speak to their competency
as regards this class certification issue.
Your Honor, it seems like the defense
wants it both ways, then.
If our clients are suffering from dementia,
then the residency contracts they signed
with Sandpiper couldn't have been
entered into knowingly.
REESE: No. No,
that is not what we...
KIM: The defense wants to claim that
their residents are competent enough
to be held to their contracts,
but too incompetent to sue.
So which is it?
Many of the residents signed
their contracts years ago.
And at the time, they were perfectly competent.
But that can change,
especially when we're talking
about elderly individuals.
Or maybe Sandpiper preyed on
mentally incompetent seniors
and bilked them out of their money.
Ms. Wexler...
I am simply trying to defend our clients
from bullying by the defense.
Your Honor, as stated in the brief in front of you,
this is a standard request granted
in every case of its kind.
This is not about bullying.
Granting this invasion of privacy
allows our clients to be doubly victimized.
I ask that you deny the defense's motion, Your Honor.
I'm leaning toward granting the motion,
but I would like to review
the pleadings and briefs again.
I'll have my decision for you shortly.
Adjourned.
I'm gonna meet you back at the office.
Ms. Wexler?
Hey.
I just wanted to say, good work in there.
Thanks.
But I'm pretty sure I lost.
Of course you did.
It's an unwinnable position.
That's why your boss didn't bother showing up.
But you went down swinging, and I admire that.
Thank you.
What are you doing for lunch?
Uh, probably just grabbing something
from the vending machines.
Oof. We can do better than that.
Mr. Schweikart.
Good to see you, sir.
Ah, how you doing, Sean?
Very well.
Can I get some drinks for you two?
Your usual Moscow Mule?
Absolutely.
You want one?
Best Moscow Mule in the city.
Fresh ginger, real copper mug, the works.
That's very vintage.
But I'm good.
Just an iced tea. Ah. You sure?
All right, then.
I'll be the sole degenerate
who's drinking in the middle of the workday.
That, too, is vintage.
(CHUCKLES)
I'll get those started. Mmm.
So, you've been with HHM,
what? Ten years?
Uh...
Yeah. Last August.
And you started in the mail room?
I did. I was six years there.
How did you know that?
Oh, I asked around.
It's a small town.
It sounds like you certainly paid your dues.
I was very fortunate.
HHM put me through law school while I worked.
That's great that they foster talent like that.
And I imagine you're paying it off
as part of your deal?
Yeah, happily.
It's a pretty standard arrangement.
I have to say, watching you in court today,
it sure did bring back some old memories for me.
One in particular, anyway.
Yeah?
I was a year out of law school
at this firm in Boston, and I was
finally put on my first big case.
This huge employment discrimination suit.
That thing kept us in billing for a decade.
Anyway, we landed this monster,
and I find out I'm second chair to one of
the partners on the preliminary hearing.
And I think, "This is it!
"This is what will define
the rest of my career."
So, the hearing's getting closer and closer.
I even get this new suit that I can't afford.
I split it over three credit cards.
I'm probably still paying it off to this day.
(CHUCKLES)
So, I go in bright and early, I'm wearing
my new suit, prepping my table,
and in walks the opposing counsel.
There's four of them.
One senior partner and
three high-level associates.
These guys have been litigating
longer than I've been alive.
But I think... "Hmm.
"I'm good, I've got my boss coming, it'll be fine."
So I'm sitting alone at my table,
waiting for my boss to show.
And I'm waiting.
And I'm waiting.
And then suddenly they're calling us
to order, and I realize
that no one from my firm is coming.
It's just me.
So I think,
"All right, then. This is the moment."
And I get up there and I argue
like my life depended on it.
I'm sweating and I'm citing statutes left and right.
And I'm doing okay. Respectable.
But I'm just a BB gun to these four howitzers.
And I lose, of course.
It was inevitable.
But later, it hit me that my boss
never intended to show.
And they all laughed about it.
They patted me on the back,
said it was my trial by fire.
And I laughed with them.
But, you know,
it never really sat well with me.
You want them to have your back.
Because at the end of the day,
it wasn't about proving my mettle.
My boss had a tee time that he didn't want to miss.
I wasn't there long.
Could I ask why we are here?
(CLEARS THROAT)
You know, I've had my eye on you for a while.
Since that Kettleman thing.
It was an excellent deal you got for him.
And I'm wondering why someone
who can put together a deal like that
is arguing a losing position with no backup.
I have no complaints about HHM.
That's great. However,
if on the off-chance
you're pondering a change,
Schweikart & Cokely would be more than happy
to put your talents to good use.
I...
Of course we'd have to have a more formal meeting,
work out specifics, but we think
you would be a great fit.
Well, I'm flattered,
but there's clearly an ethical issue here.
Well, of course, we'd take you off Sandpiper.
And rest assured, we wouldn't be expecting
any information about HHM's strategy.
Look, we're a large, diversified firm.
And just think what you can do with our resources
and the freedom to really spread your wings.
That's...
I owe a lot to HHM.
Your tuition debt?
We could take care of that.
That's very generous.
Well, give it some time, you think about it.
And you give me a call,
and we'll set up a meeting with
the rest of the senior partners.
And, to be clear,
I'm talking partner track.
Jesus, Sean, did you have to send to Moscow, hmm?
(CHUCKLES)

Are we ready to order?

for the gourmet Quick Chop.
It's the fastest, easiest and safest way
to chop, mince or dice
any vegetable. Guaranteed.
Here's how it works.
Just place the vegetable on the board, give it a tap,
and you've got finely shredded cabbage in seconds.
For crunchy coleslaw.
Tap again and chop celery...
for a delicious stir-fry.
(GRUNTS)
It even works on your tougher vegetables.
Like potatoes.
Make home fries with just one tap.
Get down.
(GROANS)
Get down.
Quick Chop peels and chops it with just a tap.
Keep tapping for freshly minced garlic.
(MAN GROANING)
The secret's the six carbon steel blades,
combined with the rotating action.
Each time you tap, it rotates
and chops on a different angle,
and never misses a thing.
One tap, and you've got sliced onions for burgers.
A few more taps, and you've got...
What's the message?
Take the $5,000.
It took two guys to tell me that?
We were just supposed to scare you.
That's all.
Then try harder next time.
Get out.
It has the power to chop nuts.
Almonds, walnuts, pecans.
The Quick Chop even has the muscle to crush ice.
Get out.
Call now and you'll get Quick Chop
for $14.99. But that's not all!
We'll also include the grater and the gripper free.
Remove the blades and it instantly converts...

I'm an engineer.

No, idiot. An engineer-engineer.
Not an "engineer."
Dale builds things.
I design things.
Spillways and drainage fields, mostly.
I don't actually build them.
Well, that's cool. Yeah.
But you could still wear the hat, though.
Right? Nothing stopping you.
Yeah, I guess I could.
I'm just saying there's no rule
about that, as far as I know.
You are such a brat!
Why the good mood?

Please tell me it went well.
Yeah, it went well.
Very well? Like, very, very?

Yeah.
So, Giselle was telling me you two
are starting a business?
What exactly did she tell you?
Oh, nothing much.
Just something about a dotcom.

with each other using the Internet?
Look, I'm sure you're a nice guy,
but she was talking out of school.
Oh. Oh.
We're full up on this thing.
Oh, okay.
We sign one more investor, we gotta go public.

You tell him you forgot.
You were rattled.

But it's your gun.
Let's discuss my payment.
Hmm, that time has passed.
No $5,000 for you.
The price is $50,000.
How about your payment is you get to live?
Not enough.
You think you can negotiate with me?
I say the word, my nephews go to a certain motel.
Pay a visit to
your daughter-in-law
and your little granddaughter.
What do you think happens then?
Consider your position carefully.
I get my money,
or neither of us walk out of here.
You're willing to die for this?
Maybe I need the $50,000 more than you do.

We made a deal.
I didn't hold up my end.
Your problem is coming back sooner than we expected.
You gonna cash that?
I might know a guy who can help.
It's better as a souvenir.

Maybe a smidge? Possibly?

Please let me be there when you tell Howard.

So why the sad puppy eyes?
What, you don't want that job?
No, no, of course I do.
I mean, who wouldn't, right?
(SCOFFS) It's a huge firm.
You get out from under Howard's thumb.
Right. Exactly.
Besides, HHM is looking more and more
like a dead end for me anyway.
Exactly. So what's the problem?
I just...
(CHUCKLES)
I don't know.
I keep thinking of you floating in that pool.
You knew what you wanted, but I got in the way.
What are you talking about?
You took the Davis & Main job because of me.
I took that job because it was the right decision.
A steady pay check? Done.

oh, five square feet? Boom.

Nailed it.
