Sorry. I can't do that.
Okay.
GARY:
This is a motion for continuance.
We're going to need more time
to prepare our defense.
The officer's report states that he didn't
canvass for additional witnesses.
There were none.
And no one is contesting
that Mr. Babineaux struck the officer.
Be that as it may, there are
several businesses nearby with cameras.
We need time to subpoena all of them.
Isn't that a bit much?
We don't believe
the judge will see it that way.
We'd simply like to have the most
complete information at our disposal.
To that end...
...we're filing a motion
to compel discovery.
You want to open
Officer Platt's personnel file.
Good luck with that.
STEF: It's a reasonable Brady disclosure.
Officer Platt had a history
with Mr. Babineaux...
...we'd like to know its extent.
And if there's any larger history
Officer Platt has with friends, relatives...
...or colleagues of Mr. Babineaux,
we'd like to know that too.
You're thinking
of pursuing civil litigation?
We are in conversation with the ACLU.
Assessing the possibility
that Mr. Babineaux's civil rights...
...may have been violated.
Okay. Is that all?
For now.
We will deal with
all of these issues in turn.
And then we will set a trial date.
I think that's all we have to talk about.
All right, then.
Ms. Wexler, a word in private?
I'll catch up.
Kim, you're throwing three $400-an-hour

I never said this was pro bono.
Okay, what's the plan here, Kim?
Because shock and awe

I do understand.
And I'm sorry to cause any problem.
You have my word.
Nothing like this will happen again.
Okay.
Let's get you to work.
I have one question for you,
Ms. Ericsen.
- Are you prosecuting Santa Claus?
- Your Honor?
Because it's like
Miracle on 34th Street in here.
This is just today.
Today's batch. Huh?
All addressed to me.
All from some backwater in Louisiana.
Uh... "Get your hands off our hero,"
they say.
"Mercy for Huell Babineaux," they say.
Like I'm sending him
to the electric chair.
Tell me, Ms. Wexler, did you start
this particular ball rolling?
Did I instruct the people
of Coushatta, Louisiana...
...to start writing letters to the court?
No, Your Honor, I did not.
That being said, it's clear
Mr. Babineaux has touched the lives...
...of many people in his hometown.
They're planning to send a contingent
to show their support during the trial.
Are you talking about a bunch
of yahoos packing my court?
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I'm not sure
what bearing any of this has on the case.
What does Mr. Babineaux's relationship
to his hometown in...?
Did you say Louisiana?
This can't be a complete surprise
to the assistant district attorney.
She knows the defendant's history
as well as I do.
If I get one more letter
from some swamp-dwelling do-gooder...
- ...I'm gonna scream.
- Thank you...
...for bringing this to our attention.
- May I see one of these?
- Oh.
Take as many as you want. Yeah.
Please. Take them all.
I have looked at this case.
It does not merit a circus.
Now, you two work it out.
- We've tried, Your Honor.
- Try again.
Pull the Babineaux file.
Every parking ticket, every time
he is mentioned in the records.
You, call the arresting officer...
...and find out what, if anything,
he left out of his reports.
I want known associates.
Places of residence.
MVD records. All of it.
We missed something,
and I wanna know what.
Right now. Go.
Ben.
What are we looking for?
I want to figure out why a pickpocket
has people this overheated.
"Huell Babineaux
is wrongfully accused.
He's a good man.
He'd never do nothing like the things

Oh, I love Huell.

Do you mind my asking,
how exactly do you know Huell?
Everyone in Coushatta knows Huell.
- He's a pillar of our church.
- Which church is that?

right over on Bogan Lane.
Um, I've seen several letters from
fellow members of your congregation.
Could you explain to me,
is there some reason why Huell...
...in particular, holds so much esteem
in your church?
I'm sorry, who are you again?
I'm, um, an assistant district attorney
from Albuquerque, New Mexico.
I'm handling a case
that Mr. Babineaux is involved in.
- Handling how?
- Um...
I'm prosecuting it.
You're the one persecuting our Huell?
How could you?
To go after someone so sweet
and kind with all those lies.
Well, I'd tell you

May I ask you a couple questions
about Mr. Babineaux?
Surely. Uh, what I can tell you
about our Huell?
Well, what kind of person
would you say Mr. Babineaux is?
Why, I'd say he's a lovely person,
both inside and out.
I'm sure you'd say that about
all your parishioners.
Right. Ha-ha. I suppose I would.
But no, no. Huell, he's special.
He's got a heart as big
as Lake Pontchartrain.
Mm. Do you mind my asking,
what did he do...
...to gain so much devotion
in Coushatta?
Well, ma'am, for starters...
...he's a bona fide hero.
- He's a hero?
- Yes, ma'am.
See, about a year ago,
there was a fire in the rectory.
It was during Bible study.
Uh, at night.
Because, uh, some of the old folks
around here...
...they like to brush up on the Bible
before, uh, they go to sleep.
You know, get right
in case the Lord call them home.
- Mm-hm. Yes.
- Wouldn't you know it...
...there was a short circuit
in the coffeemaker.
Whole thing catch fire, and the flame
leaped up to the windowsill.
Well, Huell happened to be visiting
his people, and he saw the smoke.
Well, what did he do? He burst right in.
CAMERA GUY: Pfft.
And he carried out
every last one of them oldsters.
Mm. My goodness.
And, um, what happened to the church?
The church is fine.
I shudder to think...
[COMPUTER DINGS]
...what might've happened if God,
in his grace, hadn't seen fit...
...to send us old Huell.
I see.
Now, y'all sound like a real nice lady,
and I know you're only doing your job.
But I want you
to understand something.
I think you got the wrong end
of the stick here.
Huell Babineaux is important to us.
Now, he...
He would never hurt a police officer.
I believe it's just a misunderstanding.
I believe he might've been
helping his friend.
That's the Huell that I know.
Uh, put that down, Clarence!
Get rid of them robes, now.
That's for communion.
Now, I will be with you presently!
Uh, is there anything else
I can help you with?
No. No, pastor. Thank you for your time.
- I think that's all.
- Oh, um...
Have you set a date yet
for Huell's trial?
Uh, no, not yet.
Would you do me a kindness
and, um, ring me up when you do?

but we have to hit every target...
...to stick to that timetable.
As we look down the road,
we get more flexibility.
When we get to rollouts
in the six-to-12 month timeline...
...and beyond,
we have some breathing room.
It's an opportunity to retrench and meet
our minimum capital requirements.
We should be stable as a table
by the time we start on Wyoming.
Sounds good.
We should talk about Wyoming.
Six months is gonna go by fast.
[KEVIN CLEARS THROAT]
- Unless, Kevin, did you have something?
- Um...
Sorry. I don't wanna slow us down.
Paige will hate me for bringing this up.
What's on your mind?
The foot traffic at Tucumcari
is off the charts...
...and that's driving
a lot of new accounts.
Seems to me it's because
the building itself is damn eye-catching.
Now, I want to hit all the milestones
we're talking about.
And Paige tells me
what I'm gonna ask is impossible...
...but what if we made the Lubbock
branch the same as Tucumcari?
I reminded Kevin that Tucumcari
has a much larger footprint...
...than the current Lubbock design.
And that design is the one
we've been hanging our estimates on.
I know, I know.
We're down the road a ways on this.
But what do you think, Kim?
Can you pull another rabbit
out of the hat for us?
Kevin, I'm sorry.
But I have to agree with Paige.
It took almost two months to get
local approval for the current design.
Starting over now?
There's simply no way
we could stick to our timetable.
I hate to say it...
...but it is. It's unfeasible.
Okay.
I get it. I had to ask.
Paige, you were right. This time.
All right, Wyoming, then.
Yellowstone, here we come.
PAIGE:
Great.
So looking to Wyoming...
...we are moving forward
with market research, as planned.

Most of the spoil's out and dispersed.
The tunnel's holding and it's clear.
The front loader hit
this support stanchion.
Guys had it back up in an hour.
No permanent damage.
Then the form
they use to pour cement into...
...it's totaled.
We're gonna have to make a new one
before we can go back to the wall.
So we're looking at four,
maybe five days for that.
Could've been worse.
The rock, that is more of an issue.
It is smack-dab in the middle
of our elevator shaft.
Can't work around it, can't dig it out.
So we're back to blasting.

we're a little past the halfway point.
