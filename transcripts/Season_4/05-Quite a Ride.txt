Take those, drop them off

In separate dumpsters.
Huh?






Oh, right. Um...
Fine.
Okay, when the cops come talk to you,

Tell them, uh, that Jimmy sent you.
Okay? Where you gonna be
November 12th at 3 p.m.?

Yup. This is the place.

Bingo.

No.

I suggest you do it now.
You're not going to have

- As I said, I'm fine.
- Suit yourself.

[DEVICE BEEPS]

[MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY]
All right.
You can do it?
Absolutely.
How long will it take?
Kind of wanna say seven months,
but I think I could do it in six.
Even with blasting?
Well, the geologist report
was very thorough.
With the right equipment,
modern methods...
...blasting will be quite unnecessary.
Assuming your employer
is willing to meet my price.
Price isn't an issue.
[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]
So.
Fifty-six feet down, with no blasting,

...you're saying seven months max.
[IN ENGLISH] My men and I dug a tunnel

That took us 17 weeks.

- Ma'am.
Or, better still, Your Honor.
[ELEVATOR DINGS]
Sit over there.
And leave that alone.
Not guilty?
You can't be serious.
What planet would you take this to trial?
You should work with me on this one.
Kid threw a cinder block through
a store window. I have a witness.
Frankly, I'm being generous.
I want six months probation,
time served, no jail.
And I wanna win the lottery.
- And breed labradoodles.
- Nice try, Bill.
- You won't get away with it.
- Away with what?
Come on. You're not gonna play dumb,
are you?
Please, enlighten me.
The officers took the first part of my guy's
statement before he was mirandized.
They collected evidence
based on that interview...
- ...and you knew all about it.
- That's irrelevant.
How would you...?
Why would you even...?
Your guy did it.
Bill, you don't want me
to bring this up with the judge.
Not only will your case be DOA,
but she will rip you a new one.
On the record.
- Judge is not buying any of that.
- I think she will.
It's all right here.
Listen, I... Ugh.
Okay.
- Ten months jail.
- Six months probation.
Time served.
This kid needs a chance
to turn his life around...
...not rot in prison and join a gang.
Are you joking?
We started at 18 months jail.
Up to you.
Eight months jail.
Four months probation.
- But what happened to six?
- You're annoying me.
You can't play chicken with me.
I invented chicken.
Wow.
Okay.
[OAKLEY SIGHING]
Fine.
Six months jail time,
one year probation.
I can't make four months fly.
It's impossible. Completely impossible.
You don't have time for this.
Bill, I only have one other client,
and it's a bank.
I have all the time in the world.
BAILIFF:
All rise for the honorable Judge Lipitz.
CLERK: CR2003114721...

- Four months probation.

- Good morning.
Please be seated.
If I may, Your Honor.
LIPITZ:
Yes, Ms. Wexler.
I'm happy to say the defense and
prosecution have reached an agreement.
Hey, wait, no. Stand still.
This is mine, remember?
Um, I don't mean to rush you,
but the meeting's in 15, and the traffic's...
Okay. Got it. Thanks.
I'm gonna have a probation officer
on my ass for four months?
David, listen to me.
Here's what you're gonna do:
After you leave here,
go to your grandfather's restaurant...
...and you beg him for a job.
Any job. If he tells you
to scrub the grill, scrub the grill.
He tells you to clean the toilet,
you clean the toilet.
You will show up on time.
You will smile.
You will say "please" and "thank you."
You will keep your nose clean,
you understand?
Because if you don't, you will go to jail.
Grown-up jail, with grown-up bad guys.
Picture that, David.
Really picture it.
And know this, I'm not gonna do
a damn thing about it next time.
You got it?
Okay.
JIMMY:
Nope. No.
Uh... No. Nope.
Wait, wait. Hey, look.
Doctor Zhivago is about to start.
Lots of attractive men in the snow.
That's your favorite genre.
Mm... I'm sorry, I can't. I have tons
of Mesa Verde to catch up on.
- Isn't that why you have a paralegal?
- Well, I have to review her work. Heh.

Yeah, I know. I just, uh, realized

Wanna make a good impression.
Getting the hang of the system, so...
Okay. I'll just go in the bedroom.

That's a beautiful ride.
Hey, how's it going?
You get, uh...?
You get that ink in Los Lunas?
Las Cruces.
Off by one.
And you've been inside?
No, I haven't had the honor,
but I used to be a lawyer.
Emphasis on "used to be."
And I helped a lot of gentlemen
such as yourself, and your friends here.
One thing I learned from working
with my clients...
...in the New Mexico corrections system
is that private conversations...
...are few and far between.
The man is always listening...
...on those landlines, so...
Word to the wise, uh, if you wanna talk
to your friends on the inside...
...there is a simple solution.
Yeah?
What's that?
This little baby.
It's the most compact model
on the market...
...it can be hidden
in any number of places.
And if you buy it from me, with cash,
it's completely untraceable.
How much?
Keep the rubber side down.
Sorry, guys, you had your chance.
I'm all sold out.
Give me your money.

And, um, parked too far away, so...
Tsk. I was just dumb.
- Did you call the police?
- No. What's the point?
Anyway, I don't feel like spending
the rest of the night downtown...
...looking at mug shots
of kids with stringy hair.
The hell's the matter with me?
It sounds like you were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Back in the day, I would've spotted
those low-rent little skeeves a mile away.
And they would've known
not to roll me.
Yeah? How would they have known that?

[MUMBLES IN GERMAN]
So?
WERNER:
Hmm?
[IN ENGLISH]
Before I can begin excavation...
...I must support the existing structure...
...to avoid a cave-in.
Normally, this would involve
a piling rig...
...working from above.
But there can be no activity
visible from the surface, hmm?
So I must construct secant walls...
...of CFA piles,
working completely underground.
[SPEAKS IN GERMAN]
[IN ENGLISH]
Um, difficult.
Next, I must somehow place I beams
across the top of the secant walls...
...to support the floor...
...and the machinery.
Excuse me.
Only now can I fully excavate.
I will need to move, perhaps,
1700 cubic meters of dirt.
That means trucking out
about 200 loads.
Going this deep,
we will surely hit rock...
...which means blasting.
[IMITATES EXPLOSION]
[SIGHS]
I will need schematics
of utility in the area.
You'll get those.
Once the space is fully cleared,
I can waterproof...
...then fabricate casts
for the retaining walls and pour concrete.
We would need, uh...
[CACKLES]
...about 150 cubic meters.
This is just the beginning.
And all this in complete secrecy.
Judging from the sounds I heard,
I assume we are not far from a town?
This also is not, mm, optimal.
A project like this...
...many, many things can go wrong.
